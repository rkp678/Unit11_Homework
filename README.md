#### **Part 1 Questions:**  
- Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?  
Answer:  Both the oversampling models resulted in the best balanced accuracy scores:   
    - Naive Random Oversampling Score = 0.994828  
    - SMOTE Oversampling Score = 0.994828
- Which model had the best recall score?   
Answer:  They all had 0.99 rec scores.
- Which model had the best geometric mean score?  
Answer:  Both the oversampling models and the combination model had 0.99 geo scores.
