# Unit 11 Homework: Risky Business - Rachel Pierce
## November 2021

## *Instructions:*
### Two Main Tasks:
1. Resampling Technique
2. Ensemble Learning Technique

#
## *Please refer to the following documents in GitHub:*
- The **time_series_analysis.ipynb** and **regression_analysis.ipynb** files (open in Jupyter Lab) for code details.

#

## Part 1 
### Resampling - Completed.  
1. Simple Logistic Regression  
Balanced Accuracy Score = 0.954321

2. Oversampling - Naive Random Oversampling  
Balanced Accuracy Score = 0.994482  

3. SMOTE Oversampling  
Balanced Accuracy Score = 0.99483 

4. Undersampling  - CONTINUE AT THIS STEP - ISSUES WITH KERNEL
Balanced Accuracy Score = 

5.  Combination (SMOTEENN)  
Balanced Accuracy Score = 



#### **Part 1 Questions:**  
- Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?   
- Which model had the best recall score?   
- Which model had the best geometric mean score?

## Part 2
### Ensemble Learning - Completed?

#### **Part 2 Question:**
- Which model had the best balanced accuracy score?  
- Which model had the best recall score?  
- Which model had the best geometric mean score?  
- What are the top three features?
